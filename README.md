# documentary-central-client2

(Server-side in repository: https://github.com/halatinn97/documentary-central)

This repository is a continuation of the repository: "documentary-central", the server-side (REST API & database) of my app that displays documentaries (shows, movies) to the user.
The client-side of my application uses React to create the interface users will use when making requests to, and receiving responses from, the server-side. 
It will include several interface views built using the React library that will handle data through the previously-defined REST API endpoints.
