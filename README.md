# documentary-central-client2

(Server-side in repository: https://github.com/halatinn97/documentary-central)

The server-side (REST API & database) of my app that shows films to the user is called "documentary-central," and this repository is a continuation of that source.

The client-side of my application uses React to create the interface users will use when making requests to, and receiving responses from, the server-side. 

It will include several interface views built using the React library that will handle data through the previously-defined REST API endpoints.
